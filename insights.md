# Key Insights: Insurance Claims Experience Analysis

Based on the analysis of 1,500 insurance claims, here are the critical findings:

### 1. Life Claims are the Biggest Bottleneck
*   **Health claims** take moderate time (~14 days).
*   **Motor claims** are the fastest (~7 days).
*   **Life claims** take significantly longer (~23 days), nearly **4x longer** than motor claims. This indicates a high friction point in the verification of life insurance documents.

### 2. Document Verification is the Largest Failure Point
*   **Missing Documents** is the #1 reason for claim rejections, accounting for the vast majority of denied claims.
*   Claims with **incomplete documentation** lead to an automatic rejection, often after the customer has already waited several days.

### 3. App-based Submissions are More Efficient
*   Claims submitted via the **Mobile App** are processed faster than Web submissions.
*   App users have a significantly higher **Document Completeness Rate** (88% vs 62%), proving that the mobile onboarding flow is more effective at guidance.

### 4. Correlation Between Completeness and Success
*   There is a **100% correlation** between "Missing Documents" and initial rejection. 
*   Reducing the rate of "Incomplete Documents" by even 10% would directly improve the claim success rate and reduce the operational load on the support team.
