# Product Recommendations: Improving the Claims Experience

Based on the data insights, here are the proposed product solutions to address bottlenecks and transparency:

### 1. Smart Document Checklist (Pre-submission)
*   **Problem:** Missing documents are the #1 cause of rejection.
*   **Solution:** Introduce a dynamic checklist that validates the presence of required files (e.g., photo of damage for motor, medical bills for health) before the user can click "Submit."
*   **Impact:** Reduced rejection rate and faster initial screening.

### 2. Real-Time Claim Status Tracker
*   **Problem:** Users experience anxiety and lack of visibility during the 20+ day wait for Life claims.
*   **Solution:** Implement a "Food Delivery" style tracker in the app showing stages: `Submitted` -> `Document Verified` -> `Under Review` -> `Final Approval`.
*   **Impact:** Improved user trust and lower support ticket volume for "status checks."

### 3. Proactive In-App Notifications
*   **Problem:** Delays occur when users aren't aware their documents were blurred or incorrect.
*   **Solution:** Trigger instant push notifications if a document is flagged by the OCR system or an agent, allowing the user to re-upload immediately.
*   **Impact:** Lower Turnaround Time (TAT) by eliminating email-wait cycles.

### 4. App-First Guided Claim Flow
*   **Problem:** Web submissions have 26% lower document completeness than App submissions.
*   **Solution:** Encourage users to move from Web to App via QR codes for the "Document Upload" portion of the journey. Use the mobile camera for auto-cropping and clarity checks.
*   **Impact:** Higher data quality and higher claim success rates.
